The State of Research Software
================================

The SIRO Problem
----------------

~~Garbage in Garbage Out~~

Sensible In, Reasonable Out.

PhDWare
-------

* Don't look if anyone's done it before
* Code till it works
* Generate a figure
* Throw it away

Labware
-------

* Understood by one genius
* Implements great science, now
* FORTRAN in any language
* Code not engineered for readability
* Can't add new science

HPCWare
-------

* Get a 5% improvement in performance
* On a particular architecture
* Publish a scaling graph
* Selection against:
      * Readability
      * Maintainability
      * Adaptability

ConsultantWare
--------

* Little understanding of the science
* Overengineered
* Unmaintainable by the research group

Research Software Engineers
----------------------------

Research Software Engineers
----------------------------

* Not independent researchers
    * No personal research agenda
* Facilitative, supportive, and collaborative
    * Part of the academic community
    * Deep engagement with research groups
    * Understand, study, and be part of group research activities
    * Can read and understand the papers
* Sustainable and long term
    * Institutional memory
    * Continuity, stability, maintainance

Why it works
------------

* People *want* to be RSEs
* We have been hiding as:
    * RAs who program too much
    * HPC or research group sysadmins
* We need a name, and some status
* The research system needs to
    * Measure and incentivise RSEs correctly
    * Integrate RSEs within HEIs
    * Support institutional innovation

DCProgs
=======

Old State of the Code
-----------------

* Old-style Fortran
* Hasn't compiled since 2006
* Underpins Nature-published research

New state
-------------

* Reimplemented in C++ and Python
* Use linear algebra and root finding libraries
* Just as performant as the Fortran
* Parallelised and running on the national supercomputer (ARCHER)

Sources of Software Culture
===========================

Sources of Software Culture
---------------------------

* Enterprise software

* Collaboration not contract

Continuous Delivery
-------------------

* Release early
* Release often
* Use DevOps for automated deployment

Test Driven Development
-----------------------

* Test everything
* Test first
* Test all the time
* Use tests as specs

Infrastructure
--------------

* Version Control
* Issue Tracking
* Code Review
* Code sharing
* Continuous Integration
* DevOps

Code Management Infrastructure
==============================

Github
------

Testing
=======

You don't need to test if:
--------------------------

> * Your programs always work correctly, or
> * You don't care if they're correct or not, so long
    as their output looks plausible, and
> * You like being inefficient:
    the more you invest in quality, the less total time
    it takes to build working software


Tests As Specifications
-----------------------

Testing tells you:

> * If the program is doing what it's supposed to
> * What the program actually is supposed to do
> * Tests are runnable specifications:
> * Less likely to fall out of sync with the program
    than documentation

Levels of Testing
-----------------

> * Regression testing: Does my code work the same as yesterday
> * Functional testing: Does my code match an analytic solution
> * Unit testing: Does this subroutine work as expected

Continuous Testing Infrastructure
---------------------------------

[TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/UCL)


Automation
==========

How Things Should Be
--------------------

``` Bash
fetch_dataset 53b6
run_model dataset_53b6
examine_results results_28_02_13_1_53b6_98d2
archive_results latest
create_graphs results_28_02_13_1_53b6_98d2
```

Program or Be Programmed
------------------------

* Repetition Leads to Boredom
* Boredom Leads To Horrifying Mistakes
* Horrifying Mistakes Leads to God-I-Wish-I-Was-Still-Bored

-- Will Larson

Automation is Reproducibility
-----------------------------

* Computational research can be *more* reproducible than other methodologies
* Currently it is less; how often do we replicate computational experiments?
* Automated research is Auditable Research

This Talk On Jenkins
--------------------

``` yaml
jobs:
  - 'talks-publisher':
     repo: UCL/rsd-talks
     directory: output-site
     exec: make
```

Training
========

Training
--------

> "Many of the students
being trained through the Centres will be using computational techniques in their
projects, and some may have projects aimed specifically at software
development. It is essential that they are given appropriate training
so that they
can confidently use, extend and develop software in a way that supports correct,
reproducible and reusable research."

-- EPSRC Centres for Doctoral Training Call

Software Carpentry
------------------

Software Carpentry
------------------

* Intensive "bootcamp"
* Automation
* Version control
* Unit testing
* Databases

> I found the command line intimidating at first, but after a while it felt
> like I was inside my computer.

-- A student at a UCL software carpentry event

Why you should have one
-----------------------

* More and more research uses software
* General programmers can't understand research
* Postdocs and PhD students don't have time to make reliable code

Why you should be one
---------------------

* Write papers
* Make code
