The formulation in k-space allows the wavefield to be split easily into compressional and shear parts. A perfectly matched layer (PML) absorbing boundary condition was developed to effectively impose a radiation condition on the wavefield. The staggered grid, which is essential for accurate simulations, is described, along with other practical details of the implementation. The model is verified through comparison with exact solutions for canonical examples and further examples are given to show the efficiency of the method for practical problems. The efficiency of the model is by virtue of the reduced point-per-wavelength requirement, the use of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to calculate the gradients in k space, and larger time steps made possible by the k-space adjustments.},

However, these assumptions may be inadequate, especially in the case of complex chemistries, involving multidentate species or complex coverage and neighboring patterns between several lattice sites. We have developed a novel approach that employs graph-theoretical ideas to overcome these challenges and treat easily complex chemistries. As a benchmark, the Ziff-Gulari-Barshad system is simulated and comparisons of the computational times of the graph-theoretical KMC and a simpler KMC approach are made.

The solution is based on the homogeneous wave equation for lossless media with two additional terms. These terms are dependent on the fractional Laplacian and separately account for power law absorption and dispersion. Given initial conditions for the pressure and its temporal derivative, the solution allows the pressure field for any time t{\textgreater}0 to be calculated in a single step using the Fourier transform and an exact k-space time propagator. For regularly spaced Cartesian grids, the former can be computed efficiently using the fast Fourier transform. Because no time stepping is required, the solution facilitates the efficient computation of the pressure field in one, two, or three dimensions without stability constraints. Several computational aspects of the solution are discussed, including the effect of using a truncated Fourier series to represent discrete initial conditions, the use of smoothing, and the properties of the encapsulated absorption and dispersion.},

	abstract = {A k-space method for large-scale simulation of ultrasonic pulse propagation is presented. The present method, which solves the coupled first-order differential equations for wave propagation in inhomogeneous media, is derived in a simple form analogous to previous finite-difference methods with staggered spatial and temporal grids. Like k-space methods based on second-order wave equations, the present method is exact for homogeneous media, unconditionally stable for “slow” [c(r) ⩽ c0] media, and highly accurate for general weakly scattering media. In addition, unlike previous k-space methods, the form of the method allows straightforward inclusion of relaxation absorption and perfectly matched layer (PML) nonreflecting boundary conditions. Numerical examples illustrate the capabilities of the present k-space method. For weakly inhomogeneous media, accurate results are obtained using coarser temporal and spatial steps than possible with comparable finite-difference and pseudospectral methods. The low dispersion of the k-space method allows accurate representation of frequency-dependent attenuation and phase velocity associated with relaxation absorption. A technique for reduction of Gibbs phenomenon artifacts, in which compressibility and exponentially scaled density functions are smoothed by half-band filtering, is introduced. When employed together with this smoothing technique, the k-space method provides high accuracy for media including discontinuities, high-contrast inhomogeneities, and scattering structures smaller than the spatial grid resolution.© 2002 Acoustical Society of America.},

This has proved particularly valuable in the case of antibodies. The most widely used schemes (Kabat: sequence-based; Chothia: structure-based) differ only in the numbering of the complementarity determining regions (CDRs). We have analyzed the numbered annotations in the widely used Kabat database and found that approximately 10\% of entries contain errors or inconsistencies. Further analysis of sequence alignments in the context of structure suggest that the sites of the insertions in some framework regions in the Kabat and Chothia schemes are incorrect. We therefore propose a corrected version of the Chothia scheme which is structurally correct throughout the CDRs and frameworks. To perform this analysis, we have developed, and made available, a tool for the automatic application of Kabat, Chothia and modified-Chothia numbering schemes and have carefully benchmarked the performance of this tool.},

	abstract = {Genetically engineered mouse antibodies are now commonly in clinical use. However, their development is limited because the human immune system tends to regard them as foreign and this triggers an immune response. The solution is to make engineered antibodies appear more human. Here, we propose a method to assess the “degree of humanness” of antibody sequences providing a tool that may contribute to predictions of antigenicity. We analyzed sequences of antibodies belonging to various chains/classes in human and mouse. Our analysis of metrics based on percentage sequence identity between antibody sequences shows distinct differences between human and mouse sequences. Based on mean sequence identity and standard deviation, we calculated Z-scores for data sets of antibody sequences extracted from the Kabat database. We applied the analysis to a set of humanized and chimeric antibodies and to human germline sequences. We conclude that this approach may aid in the selection of more suitable mouse variable domains for antibody engineering to render them more human but in general, we find that typicality of a sequence compared with the expressed human repertoire is not well correlated with antigenicity.

The new formulation is obtained by generalizing the classical perfectly matched layer (PML; as originally proposed by Bérenger, [1994]) to a medium in which damping profiles are specified in more than one direction. Under the hypothesis of small damping and using an eigenvalue sensitivity analysis based on first derivatives, we propose a method to study the stability of the M-PML. With this method we demonstrate that the stability of the M-PML is related to the ratios of the specified damping profiles. Recognition of this fact leads to a general procedure for constructing robust, stable M-PML models for anisotropic media. It is also demonstrated that for any anisotropic medium the classical PML exhibits instabilities related to an eigenvalue with zero real part of multiplicity higher than one. Furthermore, we show that exponential growth due to eigenvalues with positive real part can be present in the classical PML for some orthotropic media. The effectiveness of the proposed M-PML and its advantages relative to the classical PML are demonstrated by constructing stable terminations for the aforementioned anisotropic media. The method of stability analysis is developed and demonstrated for two-dimensional elastodynamics problems, but its extension to three-dimensional configurations is straightforward.},

	abstract = {Despite the significant number of isomorphism algorithms presented in the literature, till now no efforts have been done for characterizing their performance. Consequently, it is not clear how the behavior of those algorithms varies as the type and the size of the graphs to be matched varies in case of real applications. In this paper we present a benchmarking activity for characterizing the performance of a bunch of algorithms for exact graph isomorphism. To this purpose we use a large database containing 10,000 couples of isomorphic graphs with different topologies (regular graphs, randomly connected graphs, bounded valence graph), enriched with suitably modified versions of them for simulating distortions occurring in real cases. The size of the considered graphs ranges from a few nodes to about 1000 nodes. 1.},

	abstract = {The application of molecular modeling in heterogeneous catalysis research as a complement to experimental studies has grown rapidly in recent years. This review summarizes methodologies for probing catalytic phenomena in terms of a hierarchical approach. The elements of the hierarchy are different computational methods at different time and length scales that may be linked together to answer questions spanning from the atomic to the macroscopic. At the most detailed level of description, quantum chemical calculations are used to predict the energies, electronic structures, and spectroscopic properties of small arrangements of atoms and even periodic structures. Atomistic simulations, using systems of hundreds or thousands of molecules, can be used to predict macroscopic thermodynamic and transport properties, as well as preferred molecular geometries. At the longest time and length scales, continuum engineering modeling approaches such as microkinetic modeling are used to calculate reaction rates, reactant conversion, and product yields and selectivities, using model parameters predicted by the other levels of the hierarchy. We highlight some interesting recent results for each of these approaches, stress the need for integrating modeling at widely varying time and length scales, and discuss current challenges and areas for future development.},

In practice, there are often unknown spatial variations in the acoustic properties, and these algorithms give, at best, only approximate estimates of the true image. The question as to which approach is the most robust in these circumstances is therefore one of practical importance. Image reconstruction by ??time reversal??-using a numerical propagation model with a time-varying boundary condition corresponding to the measured data in reversed temporal order-has been shown to be less restrictive in its assumptions than most, and therefore a good candidate for a general and practically useful algorithm. Here, it is shown that such reconstruction algorithms can ??trap?? time reversed scattered waves, leading to artifacts within the image region. Two ways to mitigate this effect are proposed.},

The predicted distributions of the durations of open times, shut times, bursts of openings, etc. are all described, in principle, by mixtures of exponential densities. In practice it is usually found that some of the open times, and the shut times, are too short to be detected reliably. If a fixed dead-time {\textless}latex{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}tau \${\textless}/latex{\textgreater} is assumed then it is possible to define, as an approximation to what is actually observed, an `extended opening' or e-opening which starts with an opening of duration at least {\textless}latex{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}tau \${\textless}/latex{\textgreater} followed by any number of openings and shuttings, all the shut times being shorter than {\textless}latex{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}tau \${\textless}/latex{\textgreater}; the e-opening ends when a shut time longer than {\textless}latex{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}tau \${\textless}/latex{\textgreater} occurs. A similar definition is used for e-shut times. The probability densities, f(t), of these extended times have previously been obtained as expressions which become progressively more complicated, and numerically unstable to compute, as t {\textless}latex{\textgreater}\${\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty \${\textless}/latex{\textgreater}. In this paper we present, for the two-state model, an alternative representation as an infinite series of which a small number of terms gives a very accurate approximation of f(t) for large t. For the general model we present an asymptotic representation as a mixture of exponentials which is accurate for all except quite small values of t. Some simple model-independent corrections for missed events are discussed in relationship to the exact solutions.},

	abstract = {Chaste — Cancer, Heart And Soft Tissue Environment — is an open source C++ library for the computational simulation of mathematical models developed for physiology and biology. Code development has been driven by two initial applications: cardiac electrophysiology and cancer development. A large number of cardiac electrophysiology studies have been enabled and performed, including high-performance computational investigations of defibrillation on realistic human cardiac geometries. New models for the initiation and growth of tumours have been developed. In particular, cell-based simulations have provided novel insight into the role of stem cells in the colorectal crypt. Chaste is constantly evolving and is now being applied to a far wider range of problems. The code provides modules for handling common scientific computing components, such as meshes and solvers for ordinary and partial differential equations (ODEs/PDEs). Re-use of these components avoids the need for researchers to ‘re-invent the wheel’ with each new project, accelerating the rate of progress in new applications. Chaste is developed using industrially-derived techniques, in particular test-driven development, to ensure code quality, re-use and reliability. In this article we provide examples that illustrate the types of problems Chaste can be used to solve, which can be run on a desktop computer. We highlight some scientific studies that have used or are using Chaste, and the insights they have provided.

For our study, we have chosen two simple algorithms which are often taught, an algorithm for computing convex hulls in the plane and an algorithm for computing Delaunay triangulations in space. We give examples that make the algorithms fail in many different ways. We also show how to construct such examples systematically and discuss the geometry of the floating-point implementation of the orientation predicate.

The theory of compressed sensing demonstrates that such measurements may actually suffice for accurate reconstruction of sparse or compressible signals. We propose new generic imaging techniques based on convex optimization for global minimization problems defined in this context. The versatility of the framework notably allows introduction of specific prior information on the signals, which offers the possibility of significant improvements of reconstruction relative to the standard local matching pursuit algorithm CLEAN used in radio astronomy. We illustrate the potential of the approach by studying reconstruction performances on simulations of two different kinds of signals observed with very generic interferometric configurations. The first kind is an intensity field of compact astrophysical objects. The second kind is the imprint of cosmic strings in the temperature field of the cosmic microwave background radiation, of particular interest for cosmology.},

One of many obstacles to be overcome is being able to measure those forces, at the required resolution level, on vessels only a few micrometres thick. In this paper, we present an in silico method for the computation of the haemodynamic forces experienced by murine retinal vasculature (a widely used vascular development animal model) beyond what is measurable experimentally. Our results show that it is possible to reconstruct high-resolution three-dimensional geometrical models directly from samples of retinal vasculature and that the lattice-Boltzmann algorithm can be used to obtain accurate estimates of the haemodynamics in these domains. We generate flow models from samples obtained at postnatal days (P) 5 and 6. Our simulations show important differences between the flow patterns recovered in both cases, including observations of regression occurring in areas where wall shear stress (WSS) gradients exist. We propose two possible mechanisms to account for the observed increase in velocity and WSS between P5 and P6: (i) the measured reduction in typical vessel diameter between both time points and (ii) the reduction in network density triggered by the pruning process. The methodology developed herein is applicable to other biomedical domains where microvasculature can be imaged but experimental flow measurements are unavailable or difficult to obtain.},

The time dependence of the order parameter q(t)=〈Sx(0)Sx(t)〉¯—which is the same as that of the structure factor—and the time dependence of the related dynamic correlation functions have been recorded with good statistics and very long observation times. The spin-glass model with a symmetric distribution of discrete nearest-neighbor ±J interactions on a simple-cubic lattice was used. Simulations were performed with a special fast computer, allowing for the first-time investigation of the equilibrium dynamics for a wide range of temperatures (0.7≤kT/J≤5.0) and lattice sizes (83, 163, 323, and 643). I have found that the empirical formula q(t)=ct-xexp(-ωtβ) with temperature-dependent exponents x(T) and β(T) describes the decay very well at all temperatures above the spin-glass transition. In the spin-glass phase, only the algebraic decay q(t)=ct-x could be observed, with different temperature dependences of the exponent x(T). The dynamic scaling hypothesis and finite-size scaling explain well the observed temperature and size dependence of the data, and the functional form of the correlation functions is com- patible with the scaling form if corrections to scaling are taken into account. The scaling behavior and the dynamic and static critical exponents found in my simulations are in reasonable agreement with recent experiments performed on insulating spin glasses, showing that despite its simplicity the discrete model of spin glasses analyzed in this work displays behavior similar to that seen in nature.},

The method can be applied to several models studied in the computational physics such as Ising spin simulations by the method of Metropolis, Rosenbluth, Rosenbluth, Teller, and Teller, continuous time Ising spin simulation by Glauber, and the dynamic binary alloy simulation. Unlike previously known parallel multi-spin algorithms, the proposed algorithms do not change the simulated model. For example, the asynchrony and randomness of update time arrivals which are present in Glauber's formulation, are not disturbed here and the simulated update history is precisely the same as it is in the serial algorithm. The theoretical efficiency evaluation is encouraging: for 768 × 768 spins using a parallel processor with 256 processing elements, the estimated efficiency is not lower than 71\%. This means a parallel speed-up of 180 in the computations which were previously believed inherently serial. The algorithm by Bortz, Kalos, and Lebowitz can be incorporated, further contributing to speed-up.},

	abstract = {Two related numerical models that calculate the time-dependent pressure field radiated by an arbitrary photoacoustic source in a fluid, such as that generated by the absorption of a short laser pulse, are presented. Frequency-wavenumber (k-space) implementations have been used to produce fast and accurate predictions. Model I calculates the field everywhere at any instant of time, and is useful for visualizing the three-dimensional evolution of the wave field. Model II calculates pressure time series for points on a straight line or plane and is therefore useful for simulating array measurements. By mapping the vertical wavenumber spectrum directly to frequency, this model can calculate time series up to 50 times faster than current numerical models of photoacoustic propagation. As the propagating and evanescent parts of the field are calculated separately, model II can be used to calculate far- and near-field radiation patterns. Also, it can readily be adapted to calculate the velocity potential and thus particle velocity and acoustic intensity vectors. Both models exploit the efficiency of the fast Fourier transform, and can include the frequency-dependent directional response of an acoustic detector straightforwardly. The models were verified by comparison with a known analytic solution and a slower, but well-understood, numerical model. © 2005 Acoustical Society of America.},

First, a novel conservative surface voxelization technique, setting all voxels overlapped by a mesh's triangles, is introduced, which is up to one order of magnitude faster than previous solutions leveraging the standard rasterization pipeline. We then show how the involved new triangle/box overlap test can be adapted to yield a 6-separating surface voxelization, which is thinner but still connected and gap-free. Complementing these algorithms, both a triangle-parallel and a tile-based technique for solid voxelization are subsequently presented. Finally, addressing the high memory consumption of high-resolution voxel grids, we introduce a novel octree-based sparse solid voxelization approach, where only close to the solid's boundary finest-level voxels are stored, whereas uniform interior and exterior regions are represented by coarser-level voxels. This representation is created directly from a mesh without requiring a full intermediate solid voxelization, enabling GPU-based voxelizations of unprecedented size.},

We apply the method to late transition-metal (110) surfaces and correctly demonstrate the reconstruction tendency for 5d metals to reconstruct in the “missing row” (1×2) structure, but not 3d or 4d metals. In addition to providing physical insight into the origin of the reconstruction tendency, the CE also allows us to predict the finite-temperature stability of the reconstruction, the order-disorder (1×2)→(1×1) transition temperature, and the equilibrium shape of the surface islands.},

In a first step, density-functional theory together with transition-state theory is employed to obtain the energetics of the relevant elementary processes. Subsequently the statistical mechanics problem is solved by the kinetic Monte Carlo method, which accounts for the correlations, fluctuations, and spatial distributions of the chemicals at the surface of the catalyst under steady-state conditions. Applying this approach to the catalytic oxidation of CO at RuO2(110), we determine the surface atomic structure and composition in reactive environments ranging from ultra-high vacuum (UHV) to technologically relevant conditions, i.e., up to pressures of several atmospheres and elevated temperatures. We also compute the CO2 formation rates (turnover frequencies). The results are in quantitative agreement with all existing experimental data. We find that the high catalytic activity of this system is intimately connected with a disordered, dynamic surface “phase” with significant compositional fluctuations. In this active state the catalytic function results from a self-regulating interplay of several elementary processes.},

In practice, some of the open times, and/or shut times, are too short to be detected reliably, making the durations of some of these intervals appear to be longer than they really are. Under certain assumptions about how this happens, the probability densities of these apparent times have previously been obtained. It has been shown that the ability to distinguish between alternative postulated reaction mechanisms can be greatly improved by considering bivariate distributions. In this paper we obtain joint distributions, and hence conditional distributions, of adjacent apparent open and shut times. Numerical examples illustrate what insight these conditional distributions may provide about the underlying mechanism. Bivariate distributions are readily generalized to multivariate distributions which enable the likelihood for an entire single-channel recording to be computed, and hence efficient maximum likelihood estimates for the mechanism's rate constants can be obtained. Numerical examples of such fitting are given.},

They are also straighforward to encode numerically, making them appealing as a general tool. The rationale behind k-space methods and the k-space approach to the numerical modeling of photoacoustic waves in fluids are covered in this paper. Three existing k-space models are applied to photoacoustics and demonstrated with examples: an exact model for homogeneous media, a second-order model that can take into account heterogeneous media, and a first-order model that can incorporate absorbing boundary conditions.},

	abstract = {Peer-reviewed publications are the primary mechanism for sharing scientific results. The current peer-review process is, however, fraught with many problems that undermine the pace, validity, and credibility of science. We highlight five salient problems: (1) reviewers are expected to have comprehensive expertise; (2) reviewers do not have sufficient access to methods and materials to evaluate a study; (3) reviewers are neither identified nor acknowledged; (4) there is no measure of the quality of a review; and (5) reviews take a lot of time, and once submitted cannot evolve. We propose that these problems can be resolved by making the following changes to the review process. Distributing reviews to many reviewers would allow each reviewer to focus on portions of the article that reflect the reviewer's specialty or area of interest and place less of a burden on any one reviewer. Providing reviewers materials and methods to perform comprehensive evaluation would facilitate transparency, greater scrutiny, and replication of results. Acknowledging reviewers makes it possible to quantitatively assess reviewer contributions, which could be used to establish the impact of the reviewer in the scientific community. Quantifying review quality could help establish the importance of individual reviews and reviewers as well as the submitted article. Finally, we recommend expediting post-publication reviews and allowing for the dialog to continue and flourish in a dynamic and interactive manner. We argue that these solutions can be implemented by adapting existing features from open-source software management and social networking technologies. We propose a model of an open, interactive review system that quantifies the significance of articles, the quality of reviews, and the reputation of reviewers.},

We demonstrate the process of constructing mock Gaia data from an N-body model, including the conversion of a galactocentric Cartesian coordinate N-body model into equatorial coordinates and how to add error to it for a single stellar type. We then describe the modifications made to PRIMAL to work with observational error. This paper demonstrates that PRIMAL can recover the radial profiles of the surface density, radial velocity dispersion, vertical velocity dispersion and mean rotational velocity of the target disc, along with the pattern speed of the bar, to a reasonable degree of accuracy despite the uncertainty in the target data. In other words, the expected errors in the Gaia data are small enough for PRIMAL to recover these global properties of the disc, at least in a simplified condition, as used in this paper.},

	abstract = {The simulation of nonlinear ultrasound propagation through tissue realistic media has a wide range of practical applications. However, this is a computationally difficult problem due to the large size of the computational domain compared to the acoustic wavelength. Here, the k-space pseudospectral method is used to reduce the number of grid points required per wavelength for accurate simulations. The model is based on coupled first-order acoustic equations valid for nonlinear wave propagation in heterogeneous media with power law absorption. These are derived from the equations of fluid mechanics and include a pressure-density relation that incorporates the effects of nonlinearity, power law absorption, and medium heterogeneities. The additional terms accounting for convective nonlinearity and power law absorption are expressed as spatial gradients making them efficient to numerically encode. The governing equations are then discretized using a k-space pseudospectral technique in which the spatial gradients are computed using the Fourier-collocation method. This increases the accuracy of the gradient calculation and thus relaxes the requirement for dense computational grids compared to conventional finite difference methods. The accuracy and utility of the developed model is demonstrated via several numerical experiments, including the 3D simulation of the beam pattern from a clinical ultrasound probe.},

Previous wave equations which use time-domain fractional operators require the storage of the complete pressure field at previous time steps (such operators are convolution based). This makes them unsuitable for many three-dimensional problems of interest. Here, a wave equation that utilizes two lossy derivative operators based on the fractional Laplacian is derived. These operators account separately for the required power law absorption and dispersion and can be efficiently incorporated into Fourier based pseudospectral and k-space methods without the increase in memory required by their time-domain fractional counterparts. A framework for encoding the developed wave equation using three coupled first-order constitutive equations is discussed, and the model is demonstrated through several one-, two-, and three-dimensional simulations.},

General expressions are given for the distributions of the open time, the number of openings per burst, the total open time per burst, the gaps within and between bursts, and so on. With the aid of these general results a single computer program can be written that will provide numerical values for such distributions for any postulated mechanism, given only the transition rates between the various states. The results are illustrated by a numerical example of a mechanism in which two agonist molecules can bind sequentially, and either singly or doubly occupied receptor ion channels may open. The analogous theory is also given for the case where bursts of channel openings are grouped into clusters; many of the results bear a close analogy with those found for simple bursts.},

We show experimental results for these algorithms in 3D, using our implementations based on the Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (CGAL, http://www.cgal.org/).

FS-KMC are fractional step algorithms with a time-stepping window \${\textbackslash}Delta t\$, and as such they are inherently partially asynchronous since there is no processor communication during the period \${\textbackslash}Delta t\$. In this contribution we primarily focus on the error analysis of FS-KMC algorithms as approximations of conventional, serial kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC). A key aspect of our analysis relies on emphasising a goal-oriented approach for suitably defined macroscopic observables (e.g., density, energy, correlations, surface roughness), rather than focusing on strong topology estimates for individual trajectories. One of the key implications of our error analysis is that it allows us to address systematically the processor communication of different parallelization strategies for KMC by comparing their (partial) asynchrony, which in turn is measured by their respective fractional time step \${\textbackslash}Delta t\$ for a prescribed error tolerance.},

	abstract = {Ab initio kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations have been successfully applied for over two decades to elucidate the underlying physico-chemical phenomena on the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts. These simulations necessitate detailed knowledge of the kinetics of elementary reactions constituting the reaction mechanism, and the energetics of the species participating in the chemistry. The information about the energetics is encoded in the formation energies of gas and surface-bound species, and the lateral interactions between adsorbates on the catalytic surface, which can be modeled at different levels of detail. The majority of previous works accounted for only pairwise-additive first nearest-neighbor interactions. More recently, cluster-expansion Hamiltonians incorporating long-range interactions and many-body terms have been used for detailed estimations of catalytic rate [C. Wu, D. J. Schmidt, C. Wolverton, and W. F. Schneider, J. Catal.286, 88 (2012)]. In view of the increasing interest in accurate predictions of catalytic performance, there is a need for general-purpose KMC approaches incorporating detailed cluster expansion models for the adlayer energetics. We have addressed this need by building on the previously introduced graph-theoretical KMC framework, and we have developed Zacros, a FORTRAN2003 KMC package for simulating catalytic chemistries. To tackle the high computational cost in the presence of long-range interactions we introduce parallelization with OpenMP. We further benchmark our framework by simulating a KMC analogue of the NO oxidation system established by Schneider and co-workers [J. Catal.286, 88 (2012)]. We show that taking into account only first nearest-neighbor interactions may lead to large errors in the prediction of the catalytic rate, whereas for accurate estimates thereof, one needs to include long-range terms in the cluster expansion.},

The algorithm, presented in more detail in other papers (and publicly available on the WWW as VF), is now discussed with reference to its computational complexity and memory requirements. The performance analysis is carried out by theoretically characterizing the matching time and the required memory in the best and worst cases. The theoretical analysis is completed by tests on a database of graphs randomly generated. The algorithm is compared with the one proposed by Ullmann (1976): experimental results confirmed the theoretical expectations, highlighting the overall efficiency of the algorithm. Some results obtained by researchers who recently used the algorithm in application domains requiring a massive use of graph matching techniques are finally reported},

	abstract = {The reconstruction of photoacoustic images typically neglects the effect of acoustic absorption on the measured time domain signals. Here, a method to compensate for acoustic absorption in photoacoustic tomography is described. The approach is based on time-reversal image reconstruction and an absorbing equation of state which separately accounts for acoustic absorption and dispersion following a frequency power law. Absorption compensation in the inverse problem is achieved by reversing the absorption proportionality coefficient in sign but leaving the equivalent dispersion parameter unchanged. The reconstruction is regularized by filtering the absorption and dispersion terms in the spatial frequency domain using a Tukey window. This maintains the correct frequency dependence of these parameters within the filter pass band. The method is valid in one, two and three dimensions, and for arbitrary power law absorption parameters. The approach is verified through several numerical experiments. The reconstruction of a carbon fibre phantom and the vasculature in the abdomen of a mouse are also presented. When absorption compensation is included, a general improvement in the image magnitude and resolution is seen, particularly for deeper features.},

	shorttitle = {Revisiting the spread spectrum effect in radio interferometric imaging},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3424},
	abstract = {Next-generation radio interferometric telescopes will exhibit non-coplanar baseline configurations and wide field-of-views, inducing a w-modulation of the sky image, which in turn induces the spread spectrum effect. We revisit the impact of this effect on imaging quality and study a new algorithmic strategy to deal with the associated operator in the image reconstruction process. In previous studies it has been shown that image recovery in the framework of compressed sensing is improved due to the spread spectrum effect, where the w-modulation can act to increase the incoherence between measurement and sparsifying signal representations. For the purpose of computational efficiency, idealised experiments were performed, where only a constant baseline component w in the pointing direction of the telescope was considered. We extend this analysis to the more realistic setting where the w-component varies for each visibility measurement. Firstly, incorporating varying w-components into imaging algorithms is a computational demanding task. We propose a variant of the w-projection algorithm for this purpose, which is based on an adaptive sparsification procedure, and incorporate it in compressed sensing imaging methods. This sparse matrix variant of the w-projection algorithm is generic and adapts to the support of each kernel. Consequently, it is applicable for all types of direction-dependent effects. Secondly, we show that for w-modulation with varying w-components, reconstruction quality is significantly improved compared to the setting where there is no w-modulation (i.e. w=0), reaching levels comparable to the quality of a constant, maximal w-component. This finding confirms that one may seek to optimise future telescope configurations to promote large w-components, thus enhancing the spread spectrum effect and consequently the fidelity of image reconstruction.},

EC-specific Srf deletion led to aneurysms and hemorrhages from 11.5 days of mouse development (E11.5) and lethality at E14.5. Mutant embryos presented a reduced capillary density and defects in EC migration, with fewer numbers of filopodia in tip cells and ECs showing defects in actin polymerization and intercellular junctions. We show that SRF is essential for the expression of VE-cadherin and β-actin in ECs both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, knockdown of SRF in ECs impaired VEGF- and FGF-induced in vitro angiogenesis. Taken together, our results demonstrate that SRF plays an important role in sprouting angiogenesis and small vessel integrity in the mouse embryo.},

	abstract = {Aperture array interferometers, such as that proposed for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), will see the entire sky, hence the standard approach to simulating visibilities will not be applicable since it relies on a tangent plane approximation that is valid only for small fields of view. We derive interferometric formulations in real, spherical harmonic and wavelet space that include contributions over the entire sky and do not rely on any tangent plane approximations. A fast wavelet method is developed to simulate the visibilities observed by an interferometer in the full-sky setting. Computing visibilities using the fast wavelet method adapts to the sparse representation of the primary beam and sky intensity in the wavelet basis. Consequently, the fast wavelet method exhibits superior computational complexity to the real and spherical harmonic space methods and may be performed at substantially lower computational cost, while introducing only negligible error to simulated visibilities. Low-resolution interferometric observations are simulated using all of the methods to compare their performance, demonstrating that the fast wavelet method is approximately three times faster that the other methods for these low-resolution simulations. The computational burden of the real and spherical harmonic space methods renders these techniques computationally infeasible for higher resolution simulations. High-resolution interferometric observations are simulated using the fast wavelet method only, demonstrating and validating the application of this method to realistic simulations. The fast wavelet method is estimated to provide a greater than ten-fold reduction in execution time compared to the other methods for these high-resolution simulations.},

The successful development of these simulations is aided by attention to sound software project management and software engineering. We have developed “lessons learned” from a set of code projects that the Department of Energy National Nuclear Security Agency has sponsored to develop nuclear weapons simulations over the last 50 years. We find that some, but not all, of the software project management and development practices (rather than processes) commonly employed for non-technical software add value to the development of scientific software and we identify those that we judge add value. Another key finding, consistent with general software industry experience, is that the optimal project schedule and resource level are solely determined by the requirements once the requirements are fixed.},

	abstract = {Many important partial differential equation problems in homogeneous media, such as those of acoustic or electromagnetic wave propagation, can be represented in the form of integral equations on the boundary of the domain of interest. In order to solve such problems, the boundary element method (BEM) can be applied. The advantage compared to domain-discretisation-based methods such as finite element methods is that only a discretisation of the boundary is necessary, which significantly reduces the number of unknowns. Yet, BEM formulations are much more difficult to implement than finite element methods. In this paper we present BEM++, a novel open-source library for the solution of boundary integral equation for Laplace and Helmholtz problems in three space dimensions. BEM++ is a C++ library with Python bindings for all important features, making it possible to integrate the library into other C++ projects or to use it directly via Python scripts. The internal structure and design decisions for BEM++ are discussed. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the library for larger problems.},

	abstract = {Many important partial differential equation problems in homogeneous media, such as those of acoustic or electromagnetic wave propagation, can be represented in the form of integral equations on the boundary of the domain of interest. In order to solve such problems, the boundary element method (BEM) can be applied. The advantage compared to domain-discretisation-based methods such as finite element methods is that only a discretisation of the boundary is necessary, which significantly reduces the number of unknowns. Yet, BEM formulations are much more difficult to implement than finite element methods. In this article, we present BEM++, a novel open-source library for the solution of boundary integral equations for Laplace, Helmholtz and Maxwell problems in three space dimensions. BEM++ is a C++ library with Python bindings for all important features, making it possible to integrate the library into other C++ projects or to use it directly via Python scripts. The internal structure and design decisions for BEM++ are discussed. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the library for larger problems.},

As in the case of the classical perfectly matched layer when the system of M‐PML equations is discretized, the absorbing layer is no longer perfectly matched, and a small spurious numerical reflection manifests itself at the interface between the physical domain and the M‐PML. More reflections originate at the rigid outer boundary of the M‐PML, where waves that are not completely damped out bounce back and return to the physical domain.
In this work we present a plane‐wave analysis to demonstrate that the M‐PML is perfectly matched in the case of the continuum on the condition that the damping profile is zero at the interface between the physical domain and the M‐PML. We also performed a quantitative assessment of the numerical reflection introduced by the discrete M‐PML when the latter is implemented to truncate a computational domain over which the elastodynamic wave equation is discretized using the spectral element method. By means of numerical experiments, we show that such numerical reflection depends on the actual M‐PML width, the damping profiles, and the wavelength, and it does not decrease indefinitely when damping is increased. The effectiveness of the M‐PML to reduce reflections is illustrated with comparisons with well‐known analytical solutions.},

	abstract = {A novel parallel kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) algorithm formulated on the basis of perfect time synchronicity is presented. The algorithm is intended as a generalization of the standard n-fold kMC method, and is trivially implemented in parallel architectures. In its present form, the algorithm is not rigorous in the sense that boundary conflicts are ignored. We demonstrate, however, that, in their absence, or if they were correctly accounted for, our algorithm solves the same master equation as the serial method. We test the validity and parallel performance of the method by solving several pure diffusion problems (i.e. with no particle interactions) with known analytical solution. We also study diffusion-reaction systems with known asymptotic behavior and find that, for large systems with interaction radii smaller than the typical diffusion length, boundary conflicts are negligible and do not affect the global kinetic evolution, which is seen to agree with the expected analytical behavior. Our method is a controlled approximation in the sense that the error incurred by ignoring boundary conflicts can be quantified intrinsically, during the course of a simulation, and decreased arbitrarily (controlled) by modifying a few problem-dependent simulation parameters.},

The predicted distributions of the durations of open times, shut times, bursts of openings, etc., are all described, in principle, by mixtures of exponential densities. In practice it is usually found that some of the open times, and/or shut times, are too short to be detected reliably. If a fixed dead-time \${\textbackslash}tau \$ is assumed then it is possible to define, as an approximation to what is actually observed, an `extended opening' or e-opening which starts with an opening of duration at least \${\textbackslash}tau \$ followed by any number of openings and shuttings, all the shut times being shorter than \${\textbackslash}tau \$; the e-opening ends when a shut time longer than \${\textbackslash}tau \$ occurs. A similar definition is used for e-shut times. Several authors have derived approximations to the distribution of durations of e-openings and e-shuttings. In this paper the exact distributions are derived. They are defined piecewise over the intervals \${\textbackslash}tau \$ to 2\${\textbackslash}tau \$, 2\${\textbackslash}tau \$ to 3\${\textbackslash}tau \$, \${\textbackslash}ldots \$, etc., the distribution in each interval being a sum of products of polynomials in t with exponential terms. The number of terms is finite, but increases as intervals get further from t = \${\textbackslash}tau \$. An asymptotic form for large t (for which the exact solution becomes difficult to compute) is given for the two state case. The exact solution is compared with several approximations, some of which are shown to be good enough for use in most practical applications.},

An argument based on spectral analysis of a model equation shows that the pseudospectral method (for the accuracies and integration times typical of forward elastic seismic modeling) may require, in each space dimension, as little as a quarter the number of grid points compared to a fourth-order finite-difference scheme and one-sixteenth the number of points as a second-order finite-difference scheme. For the total number of points in two dimensions, these factors become 1/16 and 1/256, respectively; in three dimensions, they become 1/64 and 1/4 096, respectively.In a series of test calculations on the two-dimensional elastic wave equation, only minor degradations are found in cases with variable coefficients and discontinuous interfaces.},

The implementation of the HJCFIT method is described; it maximises the likelihood of an entire sequence of apparent open and shut times, with the rate constants in a specified reaction mechanism as free parameters. The exact method for missed brief events is used. Several methods for testing the quality of the fit are described. The distributions of rate constants, and correlations between them, are investigated by doing sets of 1000 fits to simulated experiments. In a standard nicotinic receptor mechanism, all nine free rate constants can be estimated even from one single channel recording, as long as the two binding sites are independent, even when the number of channels in the patch is not known. The estimates of rate constants that apply to diliganded channels are robust; good estimates can be obtained even with erroneous assumptions (e.g. about the value of a fixed rate constant or the independence of sites). Rate constants that require distinction between the two sites are less robust, and require that an EC50 be specified, or that records at two concentrations be fitted simultaneously. Despite the complexity of the problem, it appears that there exist two solutions with very similar likelihoods, as in the simplest case. The hazards that result from this, and from the strong positive correlation between estimates of opening and shutting rates, are discussed.},

Coupling between the spins is introduced through the assumption that the transition probabilities for any one spin depend on the values of the neighboring spins. This dependence is determined, in part, by the detailed balancing condition obeyed by the equilibrium state of the model. The Markoff process which describes the spin functions is analyzed in detail for the case of a closed N‐member chain. The expectation values of the individual spins and of the products of pairs of spins, each of the pair evaluated at a different time, are found explicitly. The influence of a uniform, time‐varying magnetic field upon the model is discussed, and the frequency‐dependent magnetic susceptibility is found in the weak‐field limit.

We calculate adsorption energies and heats of formation for all configurations of up to 15 adsorption sites using the cluster expansions. We show how the cluster expansion adsorption energies obey the configurational correlation previously observed for the DFT results. The ramifications of figure selection are considered and the use of cross-validation scores to weigh figure sets and determine predictive power is examined. Finally, we show that there are only a small number of structural motifs needed to describe the most relevant structures in the phase diagram on these metals.},

We propose a general algorithmic framework based on the simultaneous-direction method of multipliers to solve sparse imaging problems. The algorithm offers a parallel implementation structure, thus providing a significant gain in terms of speed and scalability to very high dimensions. We implement various state-of-the-art sparsity regularization priors, including our recent average sparsity approach SARA, in a new imaging software dubbed PURIFY. We evaluate through realistic simulations the performance of the software in terms of reconstruction quality and computational speed. Simulation results confirm both the superiority of SARA for continuous Fourier measurements and the fact that the new algorithmic structure offers a promising path to handle large-scale problems.

	title = {Xen and the art of cluster scheduling},
	abstract = {Abstract — In shared use clusters, scheduling systems must schedule both serial and parallel jobs in a fair manner, while at the same time optimizing overall cluster efficiency. Since serial and parallel jobs conflict considerably, scheduling both types of jobs concurrently is a difficult task. Two major strategies are in common use: partitioning the cluster (thus avoiding the problem) and reservation combined with backfilling. Both have major drawbacks in overall performance, ease of use and fairness depending on the particular configuration, which can lead to heated debates between the users of the different types of jobs. In this paper, we introduce an approach to create dynamic virtual cluster partitions using para-virtualization techniques, to deal with the conflicts between parallel and serial jobs. The system dynamically adjusts to different types of job loads and offers easy and transparent use and configuration to both users and administrators, without resorting to complicated runtime prediction or backfilling algorithms. A proof-of-concept implementation based on the Sun Grid Engine scheduling system and Xen is presented.},

The calculation of the modified distributions generally involves the numerical inversion of a Laplace transform and is difficult to apply in fitting multistate kinetic schemes to data. Our approach is to introduce "virtual states" into the kinetic scheme, as suggested by Blatz and Magleby (1986. Biophys. J. 49:967-980) to account for missed events. To simplify the assignment of rate constants in multistate schemes we make use of Kienker's (1989. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. 236:296-309) theory to first transform schemes to uncoupled form. Our approach provides a good approximation to the exact solution, while allowing the observable dwell-time distributions, and also the second-order probability density functions, to be computed by standard matrix techniques.},
